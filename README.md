- 👋 Hi, I’m @garylorenz. I am a retired electrical engineer, looking to get back in the saddle again.
- 👀 I’m interested in automating the irrigation system in my garden. My ideal outcome is to have individual closed loop control over the watering needs of each specific plant, including trees.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Arduino IDE.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smart irrigation systems for home use.
- 📫 How to reach me by email at n9946e@gmail.com or by cell phone or text at (949) 891-2586.
